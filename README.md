# Neural Networks & Deep Learning homeworks
 
This repository contains a backup of my final assignments for the NNDL exams. 
They are as follows:
- HW1: Supervised Learning (simple NN-based classifiers applied to Fashion MNIST + NN-based regressors to perform a simple nonlinear regression);
- HW2: Unsupervised Learning (mostly variations of the autoencoder architecture applied to the Fashion MNIST dataset)
- HW3: Reinforcement Learning (solution of simple gym environments using a bunch of RL staples like policy based methods, etc.)
